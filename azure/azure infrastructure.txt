Affinity group: resouce are are nearby in a datacenter for a multitier architecture
blade servers: microsoft uses blade servers in its datacenters.
		
> there is a switch on top of everyrack and racks are connecting through these switch 
in a aggregation group. Some racks are having Fabric controller which is responsible for 
provisioning new VMs, health and lifecycle of a VM.

> Stamp/Cluster: It is a group of 20 racks, all having same CPU generation. If two resources are in same
Affinity group, then both belongs to same Stamp.

======================================================================
Regional Availabiliy and High Availability
	> Regional Availability
	> Service Availability
	> Regional Datacenter
	> High Availability

> REgion availability: countries might have different regions like australia has East and East South
For some regions there are restrictions like you can only deploy services in a region if the customer is 
having the billing address in that region. For example: To deploy in EAst Australia you should have billing
address in australia.

> Each Rack work as a fault domain
> availability set makes virtual machine keeps running during downtime, If two virtual machines are running in an availability set then
they are running in different racks but can be in the same clusture.

>An update domain is a group of VMs and underlying physical hardware that can be rebooted at the same time. 
>VMs in the same fault domain share common storage as well as a common power source and network switch. (means both are in the same rack).

=======================================================================
Active Directory:
	> AD DS on Iaas (Active Directory domain services).
	> Azure AD
	> Azure AD synchronization
	> Azure AD DS


> Azure AD: It is the active directory in clould as SaaS. We can create User, groups 
and can use them to logon on other SaaS and custom applications.

> Azure AD DS: It is the domain service which we can use as domain conroller to logon to 
an Azure Virtual Machine. We can also add a machine into AD DS.

> On Premise AD to Azure AD synchronization: Azure AD Connect is the name of the application, 
which we can use to synch user from onPremise AD to AZure AD.

AZURE ACLS ( Azure Access Controll List) ( Network Acccess Controll list)

By using ACL we can config an azure vm endpoint on specific Port. 
And anyone on the internet can communicate with that Virtual Machine by using this
endpoint as per ACL rule.

We can create two type of rule. Allow or Deny. All traffic is by default deny. 
We can make it allow by creating rule.

We can assign up to 50 rules per endpoint.

Every rule has a number, and rule with less number has predecense over the rule having
high number.

steps:
create ACL
config ACL
create an endpoint and assign this ACL.

====================================================================
Azure Network Security Group (NSG)
> Each NSG has a name
> NSG's are regional, means we can not use same nsg with difference region VMS.
> NSG rule can be altered while the NSG is applied.Changes will apply to all those VMs
where this NSG is applied.
> NSG can not be used with the same VM, on which ACL is applied. So we can use only eiher 
one.
Difference in NSG and ACL
> can be applied on both inbound and outbound rules, while ACL can be applied only on INbound rules.
> In NSG we can specify Source IP, Source Port, Protocol, Destination IP, Destination Port but in ACL port and protocol specified on Endpoint side.

NSG rule property,
$Protocol: TCP/UDP
$Source/Destination Port Range: 80, 80-34,*
$Source/Destination address prefix: 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.0/12,VIRTUAL_NETWORK,AZURE_LOADBALANCER,INTERNET
$Direction: Inbound/Outbound
$Priority: 10,100,1000
$Access: Allow or Deny
$Description: "This is an awesome rule"

VIRTUAL_NETWORK: I means available azure virtual network and any connected on premise network.
AZURE_LOADBALANCER: from a connected load balancer
INTERNET: any source  which is reachable in internet

Default Inbound NSGs,
name|priority|SourceIP|source port|DestIP|Dest Port|Protocol|Access
ALLOWVNET INBOUND |65000|VIRTUAL_NETWORK|*|VIRTUAL_NETWORK|*|*|ALLOW
ALLOW AZURE LOAD BALANCER INBOUND |65001|AZURE_LOADBALANCER|*|*|*|*|ALLOW
DENY ALL INBOUND |65500|*|*|*|*|*|DENY

> NSG rule with low priority will get hit first, so if it allow for a traffic then it will not match rule further and allow it.

Default outbound NSGs,
name|priority|SourceIP|source port|DestIP|Dest Port|Protocol|Access
ALLOWVNET OUTBOUND |65000|VIRTUAL_NETWORK|*|VIRTUAL_NETWORK|*|*|ALLOW
ALLOW INTERNET OUTBOUND |65001|*|*|INTERNET|*|*|ALLOW
DENY ALL OUTBOUND |65500|*|*|*|*|*|DENY

NSG Association:
NSG can be associated to three entities,
1. NSG to Subnet
2. NSG to NIC
3. NSG to VM

when a traffic comes or out then it has to go through all three level of NSG if NSG is applied to all three level.

While creating NSG, always make sure that communication is possible to 168.63.129.16 which is responsible for azure DHCP relay, DNS recursive resolver, Load balancer + VM health probe
and outbound TCP/UDP is allowed on port 1688, which communicate with Azure KMH server and maintaine licenses.

ex:
create a new NSG
> New-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name -Location -Label
create a rule in nsg
> Get-AzureNetworkSecurityGroup -Name "asfs" `
	|Set-AzureNetworkSecurityRule -Name "rulwe1" `
	-Action Allow`
	-Protocol TCP`
	-Type Inbound`
	-Priority 100`
	-SourceAddressPrefix Internet `
	-SourcePortRange '*' `
	-DestinationAddressPrefix '*'`
	-DestinationPortRange '80'

Designing Virual Machine:
we can have,
>50 AzureVMs per cloud service
>150 input endpoints per cloud service
>100 VMs per availability set
